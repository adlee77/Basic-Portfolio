        <p>Hello! Welcome to my first website! My name is Andrew Lee and I am currently learning how to code by creating this website!</p>
        <br>
        <p>I am senior at the University of California, Santa Barbara, studying Music Composition. I am in my last quarter and am graduating early in March in order to focus on this class and learn how to code!</P>
            <br>
        <p>For fun, I like to play guitar, piano, saxophone and sing. I also play a lot of live shows - sometimes with a full band and sometimes by myself! I also love basketball, snowboarding, and photography!</p>
